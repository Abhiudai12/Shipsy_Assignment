![Shipment App Screenshot](Shipment_app_screenshot.png)


A beginner-friendly mini app inspired by Shipsy. It includes:
- Username/password login (Flask-Login + bcrypt)
- Shipments CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Pagination & filtering
- Calculated field: `estimated_days` derived from `distance_km` and `service_level`

## Tech
- Backend: Flask + SQLite
- Frontend: HTML + Bootstrap (CDN)
- Deploy: Render (Procfile provided)

## Quick Start (Local on Windows/macOS/Linux)
1. Install Python 3.10+ and Git.
2. Create a virtual environment and install deps:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   # Windows
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   # macOS/Linux
   # source .venv/bin/activate

   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the app:
   ```bash
   set FLASK_APP=app.py  # Windows (PowerShell: $env:FLASK_APP="app.py")
   set FLASK_DEBUG=1     # optional for dev
   python app.py
   ```
   The app will start on http://127.0.0.1:5000
